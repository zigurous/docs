The <a href=\"/com.zigurous.physics/api/Zigurous.Physics.Magnet\">Magnet</a> script is added to the game object that will attract other objects, and the <a href=\"/com.zigurous.physics/api/Zigurous.Physics.Magnetic\">Magnetic</a> script is added to those objects that can be attracted. This works for both rigidbodies and objects without rigidbodies. A couple customizable properties are available on the Magnet to change its strength and radius.</p>\n<p>There are many different scenarios where these scripts can prove useful. Obviously if you have actual magnets in your game, then these scripts can quickly be added to simulate semi-realistic physics. Another common use case, however, is having the player character attract items or pickups on the ground. This allows the player to collect items from a slight distance as a quality of life improvement.</p>","frontmatter":{"slug":"/manual/magnets","class":null,"title":""}}},"pageContext":{"id":"1a2c5efb-e951-5682-9b76-a299e9cc9ef9","frontmatter__slug":"/manual/magnets","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"manual"}}},
