These scripts are flexible, customizable and can be used in many different situations.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h2>ðŸ’¥ Explosion</h2>\n<p>It is very common for games to need to simulate explosion physics. The <a href=\"/com.zigurous.physics/api/Zigurous.Physics/Explosion\">Explosion</a> script simulates this behavior on rigidbodies by utilizing the <code>AddExplosionForce</code> function provided by Unity. The script detects the objects within a set radius and applies the force to each. You can customize how the explosion is triggered, the strength of the explosion, fuse time, and more.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h2>ðŸ§² Magnet</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"/com.zigurous.physics/api/Zigurous.Physics/Magnet\">Magnet</a> script can be added to a game object that attracts other objects, and the <a href=\"/com.zigurous.physics/api/Zigurous.Physics/Magnetic\">Magnetic</a> script is added to those objects that can be attracted. This works with or without rigidbodies. A common use case is having the player character attract items or pickups on the ground. This allows the player to collect items from a slight distance as a quality of life improvement.</p>","frontmatter":{"slug":"/manual/behaviors","class":null,"title":""}}},"pageContext":{"id":"a1bf63b8-3478-5ca8-97a4-ee5b68e0aba0","frontmatter__slug":"/manual/behaviors","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"manual"}}},
